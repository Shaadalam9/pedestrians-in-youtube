## Pedestrians in YouTube (PYT)
This repository contains code that extracts YouTube videos based on a `mapping.csv` file and performs object detection using YOLOv11. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate pedestrian behaviour in a cross-country or cross-cultural context using freely available YouTube videos.

This study presents a comprehensive cross-cultural evaluation of pedestrian behaviour during road crossings, examining variations between developed and developing states worldwide. As urban landscapes evolve and autonomous vehicles (AVs) become integral to future transportation, understanding pedestrian behaviour becomes paramount for ensuring safe interactions between humans and AVs. Through an extensive review of global pedestrian studies, we analyse key factors influencing crossing behaviour, such as cultural norms, socioeconomic factors, infrastructure development, and regulatory frameworks. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in pedestrian conduct across different regions. Developed states generally exhibit more structured and rule-oriented crossing behaviours, influenced by established traffic regulations and advanced infrastructure. In contrast, developing states often witness a higher degree of informal and adaptive behaviour due to limited infrastructure and diverse cultural influences. These insights underscore the necessity for AVs to adapt to diverse pedestrian behaviour on a global scale, emphasising the importance of incorporating cultural nuances into AV programming and decision-making algorithms. As the integration of AVs into urban environments accelerates, this research contributes valuable insights for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous transportation systems. By recognising and accommodating diverse pedestrian behaviours, AVs can navigate complex and dynamic urban settings, ensuring a harmonious coexistence with human road users across the globe.

The dataset is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anonymousauthor123/pedestrian-in-youtubepyt). The dataset shall soon be made available on a permanent FAIR storage.

## Getting started
[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9.19-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3919/)
[![Package Manager: uv](https://img.shields.io/badge/package%20manager-uv-green)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Tested with **Python 3.9.19** and the [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager.
Follow these steps to set up the project.

**Step 1:** Install `uv`. `uv` is a fast Python package and environment manager. Install it using one of the following methods:

**macOS / Linux (bash/zsh):**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Alternative (if you already have Python and pip):**
```bash
pip install uv
```

**Step 2:** Fix permissions (if needed):

Sometimes `uv` needs to create a folder under `~/.local/share/uv/python` (macOS/Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\python` (Windows).
If this folder was created by another tool (e.g. `sudo`), you may see an error like:
```lua
error: failed to create directory ... Permission denied (os error 13)
```

To fix it, ensure you own the directory:

### macOS / Linux
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/uv
chown -R "$(id -un)":"$(id -gn)" ~/.local/share/uv
chmod -R u+rwX ~/.local/share/uv
```

### Windows
```powershell
# Create directory if it doesn't exist
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\uv"

# Ensure you (the current user) own it
# (usually not needed, but if permissions are broken)
icacls "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\uv" /grant "$($env:UserName):(OI)(CI)F"
```

**Step 3:** After installing, verify:
```bash
uv --version
```

**Step 4:** Clone the repository:
```command line
git clone https://github.com/Shaadalam9/pedestrians-in-youtube.git
cd pedestrians-in-youtube
```

**Step 5:** Ensure correct Python version. If you don’t already have Python 3.9.19 installed, let `uv` fetch it:
```command line
uv python install 3.9.19
```
The repo should contain a .python-version file so `uv` will automatically use this version.

**Step 6:** Create and sync the virtual environment. This will create **.venv** in the project folder and install dependencies exactly as locked in **uv.lock**:
```command line
uv sync --frozen
```

**Step 7:** Activate the virtual environment:

**macOS / Linux (bash/zsh):**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Windows (cmd.exe):**
```bat
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Step 8:** Ensure that dataset are present. Place required datasets (including **mapping.csv**) into the **data/** directory:


**Step 9:** Run the code:
```command line
python3 analysis.py
```

## Adding videos to dataset
To add more videos to the the `mapping` file, run `python add_video.py`. It is a Flask web form which allows to add new footage. The form understands if the city is already present in the dataset and adds a new videos to the existing row in the mapping file. Providing state is optional, and is recommended for USA 🇺🇸 and Canada 🇨🇦. Providing country is mandatory.

![Form with new video](readme/form_new_video.jpg)
Adding new video to a city. In the case for Delft, Netherlands 🇳🇱 (with state not mentioned).

For each video, it is possible to add multiple segments (parts of the video). To add a new segment/video, it is mandatory to add the following information: `Time of day`, `Vehicle`, `Start time (seconds)` (a counter of the current second is shown under the embedded video), `End time (seconds)` (it must be larger than the starting time), and `FPS` (to see the FPS of the video, click with secondary mouse button on the video and go to "Stats for nerds"🤓; FPS value is shown as a value following the resolution, e.g. "1920x1080@30"). All other values are attempted to be fetched automatically from various APIs and by analysing the video. All values can be adjusted by hand in the `mapping` file in case of mistakes/missing information.

Each video can contain multiple segments (with each new segment starting at the same timestamp as the end of the previous segment or later). All video-level values (including FPS) do not have to be updated for each new segment (i.e., only start and end, time of day, and vehicle type of each new segment shall be provided).

![Form with new city](readme/form_new_city.jpg)
Form understands that there is no entry for Delft, Netherlands in the mapping file yet and allows to add the first video for that city. The latitude and longitude coordinates are fetched for new cities automatically. They are shown on the embed map under the video. Dragging the marker will adjusted the fetched coordinates.

![Form with existing city](readme/form_existing_city.jpg)
If the city already exists in data, the form extends the entry for that city with the new video. In this example, a new video is added to Kyiv, Ukraine 💙💛. The values in `Start time` and `End time` under the embedded video also indicate that one or multiple segments for this video are already present in the `mapping` file; in this case a new segment would be added to the video.
